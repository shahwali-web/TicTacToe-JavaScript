# Tic Tac Toe Game

A classic Tic Tac Toe game built with **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML**. The game allows players to play in a 3x3 grid with two players taking turns to place X or O on the board. The game checks for a win, tie, or ongoing game after every move. There is also a reset button to restart the game.

## Features
- Play with another player (Player 1 and Player 2).
- Detects when a player wins or when the game ends in a tie.
- Reset button to start a new game.
- X and O are displayed in different colors to distinguish players.

## Technologies Used

- **CSS**: For styling the game board and other elements.
- **JavaScript**: For the game logic, handling user inputs, win conditions, and reset functionality.

## How to Play

2. The game alternates between Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).
3. The game ends when one player wins (3 symbols in a row, column, or diagonal), or if all squares are filled (tie).
4. Use the **Reset** button to start a new game.
